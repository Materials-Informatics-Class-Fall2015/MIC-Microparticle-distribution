Slot-die extrusion is a commonly used process to manufacture films on an industrial scale. In the slot-die extrusion process, many changes can be made to the setup that affect the structure of the resulting membrane film and the location of particles within the membrane. While most research regarding these changes and their effects is focused on improving the maximum speed of production, the goal of this project will be to find a linkage between adjustable aspects of the process and the distribution of the particles within the membrane film. We are conducting this study using manufactured glass microparticles in a cellulose acetate membrane.
