##Workflow

This project seeks to find a linkage between the slot-die manufacturing process of a cellulose membrane with microparticles and the distribution of the microparticles within the membrane. As the direction we are most interested in is the distribution along the thickness of the membrane, one approach we will attempt will be to separate the CT scans of each sample into layers building up along the thickness. We will then run 2-pt statistics on each layer and and perform PCA on each separately. We will then combine this data into a single matrix to look for the influences changes in the process have on the microparticle distribution. This workflow can be seen in the flow diagram below.
